### **STUDENT**
At CNU, I have devoted a large portion of my time to academics, and even larger to extra-curricular clubs and organizations. I have participated in CRU (an interdenominational Christian parachurch organization), American Red Cross Club, Board Game Club, and a couple of club sports. The current organization I am most involved with is CNU Residence Life. I am a Resident Assistant for sophomores and provide much-needed information, guidance, and counseling on anything ranging from classes to mental health. This position has taught me leadership, accountability, and establishing a welcoming community.
### **ATHLETE**
Growing up, the community that raised me heavily pushed recreational soccer to all young children. By the age of four, I was already competing in little-league games, all be it not that well. However, this early push for soccer developed my love for sports and competing. I continued to play soccer until I was eleven years old, at which point I transition into football. I quickly began to excel in football and fell in love with sport even more than soccer. I went on to play varsity football my freshman year and became a team captain by sophomore year. In my senior year of high school, I was an All-State player and led my position in tackles. During my junior and senior years, I also started wrestling and competed in states both years. At CNU, I continued my football career for another two years before eventually having to give it up because of time constraints. For the past five months, I have begun to practice jiujitsu in the free time that I have. While I have much to learn, my athletic background has created a stable foundation and I look forward to competing in tournaments in the future!
### **RECRUITING SPECIALIST**
I work as a part-time recruiter for [Emissary Recruiting Solutions](https://www.emissarysearch.com/) where I am contracted to assist firms with their staffing needs. I have been working at Emissary for the past two years and have developed an in-depth understanding of the industry. During my time at Emissary, I have been responsible for placing over 50 employees across the nation. I have also been able to apply knowledge from CNU into real-life applications at Emissary; specifically, I have applied knowledge from Marketing and Business Law which has helped to grow our firm. Upon graduation, I am intending in pursuing a career in recruiting as I have enjoyed my experience with Emissary so far. 
### **VOLUNTEER**  
In my off-time, I like to better my community with volunteer work.”.  With my church, [St. Luke’s United Methodist Church](https://www.stlukesyorktown.org/), I am a volunteer leader and help lead many community events. My favorite organization to volunteer for is [Appalachian Service Project](https://asphome.org/) where the mission is to “help make homes warmer, safer, and drier”. At ASP, small teams are assigned to families to help with needed house repairs. I was able to start using tools and learning to fix any room of a house and the house exterior as early as 15 years old. In 2019, my team was able to build an entire back deck within a week. As a volunteer leader, my job is to organize and secure funding for the mission trip. On a yearly basis, St. Luke’s sends over 70 members to offer their services in helping ASP achieve their goals.
