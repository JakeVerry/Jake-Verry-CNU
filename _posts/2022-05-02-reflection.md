# **Reflection**

In reflection of my experience with Digital Humanities, I'm honestly impressed with the field, bringing technology and applicability to the learning environment. It is a fascinating way to study and analyze literature and culture. One thing I found particularly interesting about Digital Humanities is how it can be used to study literature. In particular, the close reading approach seems like it could be very powerful when combined with digital tools. By being able to quickly search for and find patterns in texts, we can gain a much deeper understanding of them than would be possible using traditional methods.

Digital Humanities has taught me a lot of information I would have remained ignorant to had I not taken this class. Primarily how to write towards a professional audience on popular social media platforms, code using Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and how to write a compelling Grant Proposal.
Initially, when I was first told we would be using Twitter in the classroom, I was quite surprised. This was the first class I had taken that mandated Twitter usage. Prior to this class, I had never even owned a Twitter account. The weekly professional Tweets taught a lot of professional applicability. By requiring three weekly Tweets, not only was I able to hone my professional tone on a social platform, but it also instilled consistency. I have been able to apply the skills I learned from Twitter and this class to LinkedIn and my professional work-life. I currently frequently post on LinkedIn to generate more views, comments, and shares and inevitably more leads for the company I work for.

One of the most important things I learned in this class was how to code using Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). This was a skill that I had no prior experience with, but by the end of the project, I felt confident coding simple texts. I found the process of learning to code to be very rewarding, and it has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me. TEI was a great introduction to the world of coding. My initial impression of coding was that it is solely for computer geniuses. Digital Humanities taught me that this is not the case. Instead, that coding is just a language, and once you learn the language, it is rather quite simple. Currently, I am in the process of learning JSON, open standard file format, and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. I am learning this coding language to understand Automatic Programmable Interfaces (APIs) better. Without the gradual introduction to code, APIs would have been a challenge I never tackled.

Another important thing I learned was how to write a grant proposal. This is a skill that will be extremely useful in my future career, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to learn it in this class. Grant writing is a complex process, but breaking it down into smaller steps and following a clear structure makes it possible to produce a high-quality proposal. What most intrigued me about a grant proposal is the format and the content of the proposal. Writing analysis papers or argumentative papers have been at the forefront of my experience throughout my educational career. Writing a persuasive proposal with clear intent to receive funding was refreshing and a great learning experience. I learned that it is essential to clearly express the problem in your proposal so that you can receive proper funding for solving it.

In addition to the new skills I acquired, I also found the community within Digital Humanities to be welcoming and supportive. Everyone seems to be working towards a common goal of making knowledge more accessible and understandable. My classmates were always eager to help either edit my paper, suggest new ideas, or help with the creative process. While I'm by no means done with my degree, this short glimpse into the world of Digital Humanities has been extremely rewarding. By working together, we can combine technology and humanities to solve countless problems that arise when interpreting our past.

Overall, the class has been an extremely valuable experience for me. It has broadened my horizons and taught me skills that will be essential in my future studies and career. The instructor was an excellent teacher who really knew how to relate the course material to our reality. I can honestly say I enjoyed almost every hour of this course. The discussion-based lectures were engaging, and they allowed us to share our experiences and broaden our perspectives on issues we face as students in college and as professionals in the workplace. Overall, this class has been an extremely valuable experience for me. It has broadened my horizons and taught me skills that will be essential in my future studies and career.
