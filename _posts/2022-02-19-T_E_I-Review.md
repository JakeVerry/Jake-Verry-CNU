# My Experience Using Oxygen XML

Our class was tasked with coding _Dracula’s Guest And Other Weird Stories_ by Bram Stoker using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). _Dracula’s Guest_ is a short story published in 1914 by Florence Stoker, wife of Bram Stoker, after his antecedent death in 1912. This short story is supposedly an original precursor to _Dracula_ that was excluded by Stoker in his final publishment. While not explicitly naming the main character, it is implied that Johnathan Harker is the main protagonist. For this assignment we used Oxygen, an eXtensive Markup Language (XML) editor, to transcribe sections of the text.

We were first assigned portions of the manuscript to translate into TEI. I was assigned the ending two paragraphs of page 5 and the beginning paragraph of page 6. This section was a key moment: the main character decides to go off the beaten path down the cross-road into the deserted valley, a rising event in the plot. I first copied my section of the story into Google Docs and used the comment feature to take notes of where certain aspects of the text required mark-up, as indicated by Professor Stover. This process of using the comment feature to highlight em-dashes, paragraphs, quotes, and other textual features was a great introduction to the process of mark-up. It took careful reading and close attention to catch every detail of the text.

When I was originally told that we would be coding using Oxygen, I was quite nervous about the process. In past times, I have not had the greatest experience with coding due to the steep learning curve. Coding with Oxygen was an easier process than I initially anticipated, all be it, not without its learning curve. Professor Stover did a fantastic job of walking the class through how to set up and format inside Oxygen. With my basic knowledge of coding from previous classes, I was able to quickly grasp the concept and methodologies.

Once my section of the text was properly formatted and implemented into Oxygen, the next step required using specific tags to mark textual features I had made note of in the Google Doc. Tags are used to specify how text is displayed. This is where Oxygen has a small learning curve, implementing the correct tags in the right places neatly, so that text will display properly. Understanding this process took some time and finagling, but with the help of Professor Stover’s reference tag sheet, it was easy to master.
Overall, this TEI project was rather enjoyable compared to my past experiences with coding. Once I understood each purpose of the individual tags, the process became quite simple. Using Oxygen to mark-up text is very similar to creating formulas inside excel. Much like how each formula must be properly closed with parentheses, each instance of mark-up must be closed with a tag to ensure a valid code. I look forward to using other XML editors in the future now that I have a newfound appreciation for coding.
