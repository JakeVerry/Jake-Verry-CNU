The Shape of History is a digital humanities project focused on the historical visualization of data by translating events into shape and color. Originally contrived by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, a nineteenth-century writer, editor, and educator, her data visualization method helps students and other users better understand historical events. This technique is vastly different from the traditional timeline. Events are first categorized by group and then colored and plotted accordingly on a grid. Peabody hoped each student would create their own narrative and better grasp events by translating historical data into a visual representation.

The Shape of History was created under the supervision of project director Lauren Klein as part of a larger project on the history of data visualization. This project uses HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and open-source libraries comprised of jQuery, Bootstrap, D3.js, and two.js. With support from the American Antiquarian Society and the Library Company of Philadelphia and help from her team, their work was finalized in Fall 2016.

The project is laid out in a three-by-three grid that introduces and explains how to use Peabody’s historical data visualization. All elements are contained on one website page, with each section of the grid taking the entire screen length. By clicking on the arrow in each area, the user is redirected to another section of the project. Users can also navigate via the grid table of contents in the top left corner. The purpose of data visualization is semi-coherently explained and allows users to practice and craft their own creations inside the Learn and Play sections of the grid. However, the project is not without its flaws.

Firstly, the layout of the project is confusing and ineffective. The project does not follow a sequential path of information in the traditional way. The information is laid out in left-to-right, down, right-to-left repeating zig-zag pattern. Users can easily skip major sections or get lost simply by scrolling up or down. While the developers have tried to remedy this by including sidebar arrows, these arrows are easy to miss and become all the more confusing when pointing in opposite directions.

Another issue lies in the How it Works section; users are first introduced to Peabody's data visualization concept and the methodologies behind the technique. Users click inside the grid to progress the slideshow and gradually introduce new concepts. However, the slideshow does not advance in the correct order. Slides 3 and 4 appear in the wrong order, while slide 1 is non-existent.

The last minor issues occur in the Learn section of the project. Here users are prompted to test Peabody’s data visualization method with preselected tables and events. This section allows users to choose between six different time eras, all with a varying number of historical events. The tables are labeled in a nonnumerical order with duplicate numbers for some. Additionally, the “show me” function does not function smoothly and seamlessly. When the “show-me button is selected," it does not highlight or indicate the most recent correct answer on the grid. Additionally, the show-me function does not remove any wrong answers that were plotted. These two issues combined can easily confuse users about the correct answer and the overall visual appearance of their work. Finally, the show-me section does not indicate if the user plotted the event correctly; instead, it will automatically progress onto the event.

Overall, the concept and content of the project are exceptional. To thoroughly polish the final project, developers should include minor improvements. The Shape of History should have a scroll lock in each grid section of their website. This would prevent users from continuing onto the wrong section without following the sidebar arrows. Additionally, reordering the slideshow would improve users’ understanding of Peabody's work. In conjunction with highlighting correct answers and removing wrong ones, the Learn section should also include some form of correct answer indicator. These minor improvements would increase the feel and usability of The Shape of History.
